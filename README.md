# Solutions for Advent of Code 2019

Very fun puzzles.

Everything is in python, and was written on Python 3.8. It's mostly type annotated (first project I do this). Main focus was readable and idiomatic code, but I'll admit sometimes just feeling like going to the next puzzle, instead of cleaning up. :)

Most of my solutions was written without looking up solutions/getting tips, with some exceptions:

- Day 14 part 2: I did solve it, but the program spent 25 minutes to get to the answer, which was not too satisfactory.

  Afterwards I skimmed through the reddit solutions thread, and found a much faster way of solving it and implemented it in `day14/part2_fast.py`.

- Day 22 part 2: There was a certain thing I just didn't ever think of being possible. It was apparently possible. Gave up after hours of dead ends, and checked the reddit solutions thread to get the right idea.
